Tweeter is a simple, neat, single-page Twitter clone. Any user can flash up this repo and make posts right away. 

Tweeter is currently set up to push new posts to [MongoDB], so you will have to define new routes in *index.js* and *data_helper*
files. Or alternatively, have them store locally in an object.

The icons are also sourced from > www.fontawesome.com
You can find the specifics from the stylesheet at the top of *index.html*
